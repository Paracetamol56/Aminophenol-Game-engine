## Overview

Aminophenol is a 3D game engine written in C++17 with the Vulkan API. It is designed to be a cross-platform, high-performance, and lightweight engine. It is currently in development and is not ready for production use.

## Tech stack

### [C++ 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17)

C++ is a statically typed and compiled programming language that is designed for performance and efficiency. It is a general-purpose programming language that has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

### [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org)

Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and compute API. It provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.

### [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

### [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net)

GLM is a C++ library for mathematics (especially linear algebra). It is designed for graphics software and is used to handle transformations, projections, and other mathematical operations.

### [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL))

GLSL is a C-like language for writing shaders. It is designed to run on GPUs and is used to write vertex, fragment and compute shaders.
